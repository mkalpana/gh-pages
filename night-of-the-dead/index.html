They were out trick or treating. Carrying their plastic jack-o'-lanterns they walked in-sync across the pavement and went to the next house.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The previous lady had been really nice and had given both of them more than a few big chunks of chocolate. Although they weren’t so successful on their second attempt, a bunch of teenage kids opened the door. Behind them, both Carrie and Maxon could see the big pile of sweets that would even make a dentist drool.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whatcha doin’ here kiddies?” One of the guys asked he had a blue headband which pressed tight against his bulging forehead. Beside him, there were two more boys who looked like they had recently inhaled a submarine each and two more girls who were in scary costumes with faces caked with makeup.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Trick or treating,” Carrie said not even flinching at the older kids who so obviously wanted them gone.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t have any candy, kiddie,” blue headband asked and it immediately became clear why he had a bulging forehead. Behind the group huddled in front of the door there was an extremely large pile of snacks, chocolates, candy and lollies.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You greedy pig! You’re supposed to share the goodies not hog it!” Carrie screamed in his face.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What are you going to do about it kiddie?” He said stepping forward, all in their faces. At that exact moment, both Carrie and Maxson knew they were toast that a child would have with butter. Maxon didn’t even have time to scream </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Run! </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">before those kids started chasing them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though they were disadvantaged in their size, speed, stamina and probably every other physical trait they stilled held a chance, these kids wouldn’t know what hit them because they had a strategy, all those years of playing tips wouldn’t fail them now.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Use plan Alpha, if that failed Beta!” Maxon yelled as they ran past families and more than a few groups of children to stir clear of those ogres.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They ran till the end of the street and split, that’ll buy them a few seconds. Then after losing the tails they would meet up at a different location depending on the time of the day.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maxon kept running, even after the sound of feet colliding with the pavement and the heavy breathing stopped. He still ran. Glancing at his watch, 1:17 am. He pivoted on this right foot and ran to Almond Park.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he reached there he watched in horror as Carrie was dragged off by a see-through the figure that looked vaguely humanoid.</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh hell no, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">he thought. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s not possible. Ghosts don’t exist.</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was when Carrie had spotted him and screamed for his help. He backed up as the figure turned with Carrie still in its grasp. Its eyes were endless pits of darkness and as it opened its mouth a blood churning scream tore over the town.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carrie matched its vocals by producing her own scream of equal glory. That was when he realised that he might never see her again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gathering together all his valour he charged forward but just as he reached them, Carrie and the devil’s minion walked through the portal and he watched as his closest friend was dragged into a pool of shadows screaming bloody murder.</span></p></div><footer><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on November 7, 2020</p><div class="post__tags-share"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://mkalpana.github.io/gh-pages/tags/halloween-vault-3d-entries-2020/">Halloween Vault 3D Entries 2020</a></li><li><a href="https://mkalpana.github.io/gh-pages/tags/short-stories/">Short Stories</a></li></ul><aside class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmkalpana.github.io%2Fgh-pages%2Fnight-of-the-dead%2F" class="js-share facebook" aria-label="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://mkalpana.github.io/gh-pages/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmkalpana.github.io%2Fgh-pages%2Fnight-of-the-dead%2F&amp;via=Stories%20By%20RedEagle3&amp;text=Night%20of%20the%20Dead" class="js-share twitter" aria-label="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://mkalpana.github.io/gh-pages/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmkalpana.github.io%2Fgh-pages%2Fnight-of-the-dead%2F&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmkalpana.github.io%2Fgh-pages%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F14%2FNightOfTheDead.png&amp;description=Night%20of%20the%20Dead" class="js-share pinterest" aria-label="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://mkalpana.github.io/gh-pages/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmkalpana.github.io%2Fgh-pages%2Fnight-of-the-dead%2F&amp;title=Night%20of%20the%20Dead" class="js-share linkedin" aria-label="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://mkalpana.github.io/gh-pages/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Night%20of%20the%20Dead https%3A%2F%2Fmkalpana.github.io%2Fgh-pages%2Fnight-of-the-dead%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" aria-label="Share with WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://mkalpana.github.io/gh-pages/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg></a></aside></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a class="post__nav__link" href="https://mkalpana.github.io/gh-pages/twisted-halloween/" rel="prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h6">Twisted Halloween</h3></a></div></nav></footer></div></article><div class="comments post__inner" id="comments"><h3 class="h5">Comments</h3><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_config = function () {
