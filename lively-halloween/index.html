People’s verandas lined with carved pumpkins and fake cobwebs, some even had candles and what they thought were creepy</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">orange lanterns. Unlike previous Halloweens, most children weren’t trick or treating because of all the quarantining happening. Kady’s family on the other hand thought that it was important to continue traditions. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So now she sat there on the sofa half-submerged in pillows, patiently waiting for her parents to leave with her brothers so she could take out her candy and enjoy some alone time, which seemed impossible lately.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“HEY! Joshua! That’s MY pumpkin!” Jake screamed. Jake was that young boy in everyone’s family that fussed over everything and if something didn’t go his way… he threw a tantrum.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here,” Joshua sighed and gave Jake his pumpkin. Joshua was the cool-headed and responsible brother who managed to earn the respect of an adult. Living in a family with five meant that conversations almost always ended in screaming and hair-pulling. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just when she thought she could have some peace and quiet her two brothers decided to enter her space.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now now, don’t fight.” Their mother calmly said. She was every family’s wonderful mother who loved her kids beyond this universe. Their mother thought that it was a bad idea to go out during a pandemic but then again it was just once on a special occasion.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who’s ready for some trick or treating!!!” Dad yelled from upstairs.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are, now come down honey.” Their dad descended the stars and Kady had trouble holding in her laughter as her father came into view.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What do you think?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You look hilarious! People will definitely give us candy!” Jake yelled as he looked father up and down. He looked like he tried to dress as a scary vampire but for some reason, it looked more like a vampire monkey than the corpse that sucks blood from living people’s necks.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, enjoy having fun walking down deserted streets with a high chance of being eaten by monsters!” Kady enthusiastically wished her family. Earning an eye-roll form Joshua and a glare from her parents while Jake screamed for the second time in five minutes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What do you mean by getting eaten by monsters!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t listen to her, she’s just trying to make us you,” said Joshua rolling his eyes again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not scared!” Jake yelled, now she strongly believed that for a nine-year-old Jake couldn’t open his mouth without screaming or yelling.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, there’s food in the fridge and some tea on the stove. Please be careful darling.” Their mother said before opening the door for Joshua and Jake. The three of them walking out the door and onto the pavement.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You sure you don’t want to come along? You don’t have to dress up,” her father offered and she shook her head.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nah, you four have fun!” She yelled at her family as her father jogged to catch up with the rest of their family.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kady slowly closed the door and retrieved her box of candy which she was had been stashing since the beginning of September. Plopping down on the sofa she started to open a packet of m&amp;m’s popping one into her mouth. She grabbed the tv’s remote and turned the tv on to some random channel doing a Halloween special and slowly started to go through her month’s stockpile.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was when it started to happen.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lights started to flicker and the tv turned static. Slowly every room in the house was flooded in darkness. Kady sat there as still as a statue on the sofa, her fist full of candy corn midway her mouth.</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mistress, why have you summoned us. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A voice rang through the house, shaking its foundations and flakes of cement rained down like snow.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I haven’t summoned anyone!” Kady yelled. “Come on! I know it’s you, Joshua and Jake! Why do you ruin my only alone time!”</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not a mortal mistress, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the voice threw back</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, if my assistance is not needed shall I leave?</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That voice is so phoney.”</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is very real mistress, my patience is what’s phoney.</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Come out!”</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you wish…</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The floor near the basement creaked and Kady watched in horror as a hooded figure emerged from the corridor.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who are you? What are you doing here? If you’re a burglar then know that I know how to throw a punch.” Kady bluffed, she was good at hacking not fighting. Maybe she could talk her way through this.</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who am I? More like what am I. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The figure said as it lowed its hood making Kady want to scream. Half of its face was beautiful beyond belief, like Aphrodite’s face she could say but the other half was rotten to the skull, the skin just barely holding onto the bone.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why are you here?”</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You told your brothers that they could be eaten by monsters and it turns out you’re right.</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What do you mean?!?”</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think you know Kady.</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Call it off, leave my family alone!”</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you sure? This could be the only chance of getting rid of them without being convicted.</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re a twisted psychopath! I’ll repeat myself once more. Leave. My. Family. Alone.”</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">But are you-</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you want me to spell it for you? ‘Cuz I can.” Kady knew what she had to do, she had to act brave and like she had something up here sleeve if this </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">thing </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">didn’t corporate.</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alright, mistress.</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s not all. You also have to return everything to normal, like before you come here and leave and never return.” Kady ordered with her sternest face before her sight became black.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">P</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">T</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">H</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">B</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">L</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">K</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She felt sluggish, her eyes felt glued together and she struggled to move her body.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wake up Kady, we’re home.” An annoying voice stretched the speech. She sat up all of a sudden as the light got flipped on.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Looks like you slept off while watching tv!” Jake giggled.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why is there candy all over the floor!” Her mother complained.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahh, all the sweet noises of a family.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you all fine? Did you see any monsters?” Kady asked, genuinely worried for her family.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nope, all in one piece, but my feet do feel like they’re ready to burst.” Her father voiced as he ascended the stairs.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That meant that it was all a dream, right?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Honey, whose robes are these?”</span></p></div><footer><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on November 5, 2020</p><div class="post__tags-share"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://mkalpana.github.io/gh-pages/tags/editors-pick/">Editor&#x27;s pick</a></li><li><a href="https://mkalpana.github.io/gh-pages/tags/halloween-vault-3d-entries-2020/">Halloween Vault 3D Entries 2020</a></li><li><a href="https://mkalpana.github.io/gh-pages/tags/short-stories/">Short Stories</a></li></ul><aside class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmkalpana.github.io%2Fgh-pages%2Flively-halloween%2F" class="js-share facebook" aria-label="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://mkalpana.github.io/gh-pages/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmkalpana.github.io%2Fgh-pages%2Flively-halloween%2F&amp;via=Stories%20By%20RedEagle3&amp;text=Lively%20Halloween" class="js-share twitter" aria-label="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://mkalpana.github.io/gh-pages/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmkalpana.github.io%2Fgh-pages%2Flively-halloween%2F&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmkalpana.github.io%2Fgh-pages%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F10%2F163a70062730ef76309128658978.png&amp;description=Lively%20Halloween" class="js-share pinterest" aria-label="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://mkalpana.github.io/gh-pages/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmkalpana.github.io%2Fgh-pages%2Flively-halloween%2F&amp;title=Lively%20Halloween" class="js-share linkedin" aria-label="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://mkalpana.github.io/gh-pages/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Lively%20Halloween https%3A%2F%2Fmkalpana.github.io%2Fgh-pages%2Flively-halloween%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" aria-label="Share with WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://mkalpana.github.io/gh-pages/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg></a></aside></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__next"><a class="post__nav__link" href="https://mkalpana.github.io/gh-pages/lock-on-the-floor/" rel="prev">Next Post<h3 class="h6">Lock on the Floor</h3></a></div></nav></footer></div></article><div class="comments post__inner" id="comments"><h3 class="h5">Comments</h3><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_config = function () {
