Now </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is what happens when someone doesn’t do their share of work, she thought to herself as she grabbed both of the handles and carefully lifted it up, trying not to drop anything. The attempt was in vain as cardboard boxes and pieces of crumpled paper cascaded onto the floor. Sighing, she stepped over the pile that had formed on the ground and walked to the front door.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ma! Benjamin! There’s a bit of paper on the floor! I’ll pick it up later!” Annie told the current residents of the house, their father went to get milk five years ago and to this day they still didn’t receive that dam milk carton.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the recycling was done she went to the laundry room and gathered up all the clothes into a basket and grabbed some pegs. This time she walked into the back yard and walked over to the drying line near the old shed that hadn’t been used in a few years and an out-of-stock dunny.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was then that it happened like it did every Halloween.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All around her fireflies started to appear, illuminating the evening. Handy, she thought. Do you know what fireflies are the best at doing? Lightin’ up the area. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, someone didn’t agree. The neighbours in their backyard mumbled under their breath and wobbled back inside their house. Annie didn’t find their reactions strange, every year on Halloween these fireflies would surround her, whether she was inside, outside or on the way inside. They were always there. And as if on cue the neighbours would go inside and lock all their doors tight.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The neighbours were an old couple from the UK, they use to always came over during New Years and sometimes even Christmas but ever since those fireflies appeared they kept their distance. At first, they warned mother that it was an omen of death but as the fireflies came each year, she waved the warnings away as superstition.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But they’re jack o’lanters, corpse candles, the dead man’s candles!” The old lady would warn as if the words would mean something to us.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t be silly, those are just fairytales.” Mother said.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Blimey, whatever you say. They’re watching. You better watch out. We warned you. Don’t say we didn’t.” The old man said, looking at me with his one dark brown eye and his other milky white eye, almost as if he could see with two of them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After they had left that day, so many years ago she couldn’t sleep as the fireflies came and surrounded her. She tossed and turned, their voices in her ears, she jumped at every small sound, wondering if a demon would jump out and murder her right there on the spot. But the night came and went, she was alive and over the next few years she agreed with her mother, it was just a scary Halloween story based on raw superstition.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an odd thing, those fireflies. They would come and go, come and go, like the tide. She always dismissed them as fireflies but boy did she wish she didn’t. After pegging up all the laundry she turned to walk back inside. Suddenly one of the fireflies touched her skin, scorching her. Looking closer, she realised that they weren’t fireflies, they were orbs of heat.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie picked up her pace and shut herself in the house, the neighbours were right, they were corpse candles! How? How, is it possible? It was just folklore, not the truth. Her heart beating in her ears she raced up the stairs to Benjamin’s room. Swinging open the door she realised with horror that the room was bare. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running back down to the hall to her mother’s room, she noticed that their pictures were missing and that the lounge room was also furniture less. Swallowing the lump that was forming in her throat she threw open the door and cried, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">mother! </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that room was also stripped bare.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were no traces of the Winchester family.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She edged closer to the window which was frosted, she slowly wiped her sleeve and looked out. The lawn was a mess, the streets had changed, the moon was a deep honey yellow, casting elongated shadows.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shuddering she backed up, away from the window. Where neighbours still next door? Even if they were she doubted that they’d let her stay with them. Why was the house empty? What had happened to Ben and mother?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You were a good child,” a voice said from behind her and like a mouse she froze in her tracks. “What a pity you were marked by the candles.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie cautiously turned around and her breath caught, it was mother but also not at the same time. You see instead of fingers she had talons, long, sharp, blood-covered talons.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Come here deary,” it cooed.</span></p></div><footer><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on November 7, 2020</p><div class="post__tags-share"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://mkalpana.github.io/gh-pages/tags/halloween-vault-3d-entries-2020/">Halloween Vault 3D Entries 2020</a></li><li><a href="https://mkalpana.github.io/gh-pages/tags/short-stories/">Short Stories</a></li></ul><aside class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmkalpana.github.io%2Fgh-pages%2Fambassadors-uks-the-harbinger%2F" class="js-share facebook" aria-label="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://mkalpana.github.io/gh-pages/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmkalpana.github.io%2Fgh-pages%2Fambassadors-uks-the-harbinger%2F&amp;via=Stories%20By%20RedEagle3&amp;text=Ambassadors%20UK's%20The%20Harbinger" class="js-share twitter" aria-label="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://mkalpana.github.io/gh-pages/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmkalpana.github.io%2Fgh-pages%2Fambassadors-uks-the-harbinger%2F&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmkalpana.github.io%2Fgh-pages%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F12%2F163e7467bcaa8cb0423950609030.png&amp;description=Ambassadors%20UK's%20The%20Harbinger" class="js-share pinterest" aria-label="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://mkalpana.github.io/gh-pages/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmkalpana.github.io%2Fgh-pages%2Fambassadors-uks-the-harbinger%2F&amp;title=Ambassadors%20UK's%20The%20Harbinger" class="js-share linkedin" aria-label="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://mkalpana.github.io/gh-pages/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Ambassadors%20UK's%20The%20Harbinger https%3A%2F%2Fmkalpana.github.io%2Fgh-pages%2Fambassadors-uks-the-harbinger%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" aria-label="Share with WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://mkalpana.github.io/gh-pages/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg></a></aside></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a class="post__nav__link" href="https://mkalpana.github.io/gh-pages/lock-on-the-floor/" rel="prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h6">Lock on the Floor</h3></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a class="post__nav__link" href="https://mkalpana.github.io/gh-pages/twisted-halloween/" rel="prev">Next Post<h3 class="h6">Twisted Halloween</h3></a></div></nav></footer></div></article><div class="comments post__inner" id="comments"><h3 class="h5">Comments</h3><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_config = function () {
